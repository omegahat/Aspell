Package: Aspell
Version: 0.2-0
Title: Interface to aspell library
Description: An interface for R to facilities in the aspell library
  to provide a mechanism by which we can check spelling of different
  text such as help files, XML documentation, text analysis of documents, 
  finding help words, GUI facilities in R, etc.  
  We can also explore different approaches to predicting correct spelling.
Note:  It is not clear that  we need this in R as we delegate the spell
   checking to other tools such as Emacs, Word Processors, etc.
   However, there are numerous errors in the Rd files in packages
   and it may make it easier to check them if the tools are available in R.
   We want to do quality control tests during R CMD check.
   Also, this is an interesting library  to explore in terms of constructing
   an interface to it from S in an automated manner.
   Google's spell checking facilities are also very convenient.
