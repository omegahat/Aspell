<dl>
      
  <dt> Put finalizers on the references.
  <dd> Now on speller.
        Configuration objects we need more care as they could be in
        a speller.  Does aspell figure out what is going on for us?
        It is added, except for the case that we get it from the speller.

  <dt>  $<- and [<-
  <dd>  $<- done.

  <dt>  $ accessor for AspellConfig is very slow. 
  <dd> Profile it.


  <dt>
  <li>  Module info.
  <dd>   In place, but needs testing. Crashing at times.
      <br>
       dict_dirs is causing the problem. So that one element is now
  turned off.
      
  <dt> Filters, documents, etc.
  <dd>  Documents okay. Filters - just set them in the
       config$add-filter technique.
      <br>
          In the future, could write our own filter in R!

  <dt> Think how to get the setSpellConfig() and $&lt;-, etc. to add
      to a list

  <dd> Done. Could use some cleanup.
<pre>
      conf$"add-filter" <- "url"

      conf$"add-filter" <- c("url", "email")
</pre>

     Use clear- to remove an element.


  <dt> Word lists.
  <dd> as.character()
      Causing problems - seg faults. Appears to be fixed now.
